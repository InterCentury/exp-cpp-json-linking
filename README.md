# exp-cpp-json-linking

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a **sandbox / experimental workspace** focused on learning and testing **JSON linking and handling in C++**.

The goal is to understand how JSON libraries integrate with C++, how data flows between files and code, and what pitfalls or best practices exist — before using these techniques in larger projects.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repo exists to:

- Experiment with JSON parsing and serialization in C++
- Test different approaches and libraries
- Break things safely without affecting main projects
- Document discoveries, mistakes, and solutions
- Preserve knowledge for future reference

This repository directly supports learning for larger projects (e.g., system tools, utilities, or personal projects).

---

## 🧪 What Is Being Experimented Here
- JSON file structure design
- Reading JSON data into C++ programs
- Writing C++ data back to JSON
- Error handling and edge cases
- Linking JSON libraries with C++ projects
- Performance and usability observations

---

## 📚 Libraries / Tools Used
- C++
- JSON library (example: `nlohmann/json` or others)
- Compiler: (GCC / MSVC / Clang — depending on experiment)
- Build system: (if applicable)

> Note: Libraries may change as experiments evolve.

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far
- How JSON integrates with C++ at compile-time and runtime
- Common errors while parsing malformed JSON
- Best practices for organizing JSON configuration files
- Differences between manual parsing vs library-based parsing
- How to debug JSON-related crashes and exceptions

(This section will grow over time.)
